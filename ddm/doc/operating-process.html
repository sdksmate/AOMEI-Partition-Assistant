			<p><strong>Displaying operation results</strong><strong> </strong><br>
Results of any disk partition operation are immediately displayed in the Dynamic Disk Manager main window.

Any volume changes, including resizing, moving and labeling are also immediately displayed in the main window.</p>

			<p><strong>View/Commit Pending Operations </strong></p>
			<ol>
			 <li>All operations are pending until the user issues the command for the changes to be made permanent. Until then, Aomei Dynamic Disk Manager will only show the results that are provided by operations.
