		The dynamic disk was first introduced in Windows 2000, and Microsoft added the dynamic disk management into the built-in Disk Management. Compared with basic disk, a dynamic disk can store one or more volumes and one volume could also occupy more than one disk. So that dynamic disks are most effective if your machine has more than one hard disk drive.

			  <p><strong>Highlights of Dynamic Disk</strong></p>
			  <ul>
			    <li>Create a large volume that occupies several disks.</li>
                <li>Add fault-tolerance to your system and data, by mirroring a volume¡ªsuch as the one with the operating system¡ªto another disk. If a disk with one of these mirrors fails, no data will be lost on such volume.</li>
                <li>You could create simple volume, spanned volume, striped volume, mirrored volume and RAID5 volume.</li>
		        <li>Simple volume and spanned volume can be expanded to increase their capacity by Windows built-in Disk Manager.</li>
		    </ul>
